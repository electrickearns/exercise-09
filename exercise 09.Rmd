## Prelims
These packages are used in this exercise. Make sure they are installed and active!

```
{r}
install.packages ("tidyverse")
library (tidyverse)

install.packages ("skimr")
library (skimr)
```

## Step one
Load in the data as a tibble named d
```
{r}
f <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difiore/ada-2024-datasets/main/Street_et_al_2017.csv"
d <- read_csv (f, col_names=TRUE) 
```

Then produce an exploratory data analysis with a five number summary including medium, min and max, and 1st and 3rd quartile values. Additionall, mean and sd should be generated. Do this for each quantitive variable. 

This can be achieved for each variable in long form using the summary function and a long code as seen in a previous exercise, or done concisely with the {skim()} function.

```
{r}
exploratory <- skim (d, Social_learning, Research_effort, ECV, Group_size, Gestation, Weaning, Longevity, Sex_maturity, Body_mass, Maternal_investment, Repro_lifespan)
```

## Step two
Plot ECV (brain size) as a function of social group size (Group_size), Longevity, juvenile period length (Weaning), and reproductive lifespan (Repro_lifespan)

```
{r}
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
attach(d) 
plot(x = Group_size, y = ECV)
plot(x = Longevity, y = ECV)
plot(x = Weaning, y = ECV)
plot(x = Repro_lifespan, y = ECV)

# And the same with the data transformed for visual clarity
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
attach(d) 
plot(x = log(Group_size), y = log(ECV))
plot(x = log(Longevity), y = log(ECV))
plot(x = log(Weaning), y = log(ECV))
plot(x = log(Repro_lifespan), y = log(ECV))
```

## Step three
